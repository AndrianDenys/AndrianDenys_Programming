# Tutorial I


### Introduction
This is part one of the tutorial series, dedicated to creating a dice-throwing mechaninc in Unity3D. In this part we are going to start with camera controls and set up board for future use. 


### Blocking out the board

*You may skip this, if you are here for camera controls.*

To do this, go to GameObject -> 3D Object -> Cube/Plane. Build of this blocks box-shaped board, so that our dice dont fall out. After all of them are set up, click on each one and click **Add Component** button, then serach for Box Collider and add it. Make sure, that **Is Trigger** is turned off. 


### Setting up camera
Lets now start work on the actual camera. First of all, we need to position it properly, facing downwards. You may use **Rotate** tool directly on camera or enter values on righthandside manualy. Tilt camera to 60-80 degrees to your liking. You can check the result in camera window or by pressing Play button.
