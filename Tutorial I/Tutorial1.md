# Tutorial I


### Introduction
This is part one of the tutorial series, dedicated to creating a dice-throwing mechaninc in Unity3D. In this part we are going to start with camera controls and set up board for future use. 


### Blocking out the board
You may skip this, if you are here for camera controls. 


### Setting up camera
Lets now start work on the actual camera. First of all, we need to position it properly, facing downwards. You may use **Rotate** tool directly on camera or enter values on righthandside manualy. Tilt camera to 60-80 degrees to your liking. You can check the result in camera window or by pressing Play button.
